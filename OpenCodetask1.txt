GIT VS GITHUB


->GIT IS A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM. IT BASICALLY SAVES DIFFERENT VERSION OF AN APPLICATION. 
->IF A USER MAKES ANY CHANGE TO THE FILE, THEN GIT KEEPS TRACK OF IT.
->GIT IS INSTALLED IN LOCAL COMPUTER SYSTEM (IN WHICH USER IS WORKING AND MAKING CHANGES TO FILE).
->IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN THE LATER VERSIONS OF THE APPLICATION THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS AND REVERT THE CHANGES. 




->GITHUB IS A WEBSITE THAT WORKS WITH GIT REMOTELY(ONLINE). ANY GIT REPOSITORY OF A PROJECT CAN BE UPLOADED IN GITHUB FROM A LOCAL SYSTEM SO THAT THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS OF THE GROUP CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROJECT AND THEN PULL THAT PROJECT IN THEIR SYSTEM.  




5 BASIC GIT COMMANDS


git init :- it creates a new Git repository.
git clone :- it creates a working copy a repository.
git add :-  this command add files
git status :- it is used to list the files that's been changed.
git pull :- it  is used to fetch and merge changes on the remote server.

AFTER MAKING THE CHANGES, WE'LL USE GIT ADD AND GIT COMMIT COMMAND TO COMMIT THE CHANGES IN THE REPOSITORY.
THEN WE'LL USE GIT PUSH COMMAND TO UPLOAD THE CHANGES INTO THE REPOSITORY.
